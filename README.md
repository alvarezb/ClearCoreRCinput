Code to run the Mega Turret on a clearcore. Uses the clearcore arduino wrapper (https://www.teknic.com/files/downloads/manual_install_instructions_arduino.pdf) and the BolderFlight SBUS library (https://github.com/bolderflight/sbus), both of which must be installed.

To use the receiver, it must be set to SBUS output (inverted)
